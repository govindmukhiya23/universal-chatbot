## 🎯 **How to Use Real-time Conversation:**

### Step 1: Access Real-time Mode
1. Open the chatbot at `http://localhost:5000`

3. The real-time conversation modal will open

### Step 2: Start Real-time Conversation
1. **Hold down** the "Hold to Speak" button
2. Start speaking - you'll see your words appear in real-time (gray/italic = interim, black = final)
3. **Release** the button when done speaking
4. The bot will respond immediately with translation and reply

### Step 3: Features You'll See
- **Live transcription** as you speak
- **Automatic translation** of your speech
- **Bot responses** in your target language
- **Voice synthesis** of bot replies (if enabled)

## 🌟 **New Features:**

### 1. **Interim Transcription**
- See your speech being transcribed in real-time
- Gray, italic text shows what you're currently saying
- Black text shows finalized speech

### 2. **Visual Feedback**
- Recording button turns red and pulses when active
- Glowing border effect during recording
- Clear start/stop indicators

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
- Graceful handling of speech recognition errors
- Automatic restart of recognition if it stops
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

### 4. **Better WebSocket Communication**
- Separate events for real-time vs regular chat
- Proper handling of real-time responses
- Reduced latency for real-time interactions

## 🎮 **Controls:**

### Push-to-Talk Mode (Recommended)
- **Press and hold** the "Hold to Speak" button
- **Speak clearly** into your microphone
- **Release** when finished
- Bot responds automatically

### Settings for Real-time Mode
- Set your language in Settings panel
- Enable/disable voice responses
- Choose bot language for translation

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### Microphone Not Working
1. **Browser permissions:** Ensure microphone access is allowed
2. **HTTPS required:** Voice features require HTTPS (localhost works)
3. **Refresh the page** if microphone seems stuck
4. **Check browser console** for error messages

### Speech Recognition Issues
1. **Speak clearly** and not too fast
2. **Wait for interim text** to appear before releasing button
3. **Check language settings** match your speech language
4. **Try different browsers** (Chrome works best)

### Real-time Mode Not Opening
1. **Refresh the page** completely
2. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
3. **Ensure WebSocket connection** is working (check connection status)

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix:**

### Test 1: Basic Real-time Chat
1. Click conversation icon to open real-time mode
2. Hold "Hold to Speak" button
3. Say "Hello, how are you?"
4. Release button
5. Should see transcription → translation → bot response

### Test 2: Multi-language Translation
1. In Settings, set your language to English
2. Set bot language to Spanish
3. Speak in English
4. Should receive Spanish response

### Test 3: Voice Output
1. Enable "voice responses" in Settings
2. Speak to the bot in real-time mode

## 📊 **Performance:**
